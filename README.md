# user-churn-project
•	Developed python algorithms for telecommunication vendors to predict user churn probability.

•	Preprocessed data by data cleaning, categorical features transformation and scaling data.

•	Trained supervised machine learning models including Logistic Regression, K-nearest Neighbors, Random Forest and regularization with optimal parameters avoid overfitting.

•	Evaluated model performance via confusion matrix and k-fold cross validation to find the optimal model (Random Forest) that gives better prediction accuracy and analyzed feature importance to identify top factors that influence user retention.
